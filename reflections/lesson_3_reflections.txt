When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  	When I want others to collaborate in my project, I would go for a remote repository
  	instead of a local one.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    There may be some changes that were made by other contributers to the 
    remote repo that are not up-to-date. In those situations, if git
    automatically pulls the changes to the local work, all the updated
    might get over-written.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Branches are basically a new seperate head to the repository. You can
    modify the code in a branch freely without breaking your code in your
    master branch.
    Clone is to get a git repository on your local workspace for editing.
    It could be from gitHub or from any other local repository.
    Fork is same as Clone expect it is on your gitHub account. You call 
    cloning a fork when you clone a gitHub repository to your own gitHub
    account without first cloning it to your local work space.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It will be helpful while merging. If the last state of remote is known, 
    and all the changes were made on top of the same branch, git merge will 
    just do a fast-forward merge when we update the origin/master.
