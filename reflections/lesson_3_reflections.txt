When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  	When I want others to collaborate in my project, I would go for a remote repository

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    There may be some changes that were made by other contributers to the

    automatically pulls the changes to the local work, all the updated
    might get over-written.
